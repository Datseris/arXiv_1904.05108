This code repository contains all scripts and source code necessary to reproduce our results from our paper "Estimating Lyapunov exponents in billiards", which is on arXiv: [1904.05108](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05108).
The repository even includes code to reproduce the paper figures (but of course one has to first re-create the data by running the scripts).

To install the code:
1. Install Julia v1+.
2. Download this repo.
3. Open Julia, and change directory to this repo folder.
4. Type `]` to access the package manager and then type the commands `activate .` and `instantiate`.

Everything will be installed for you and all code will be runnable :)

**Disclaimer** : The code here is guaranteed to run for the package versions included in the `Manifest.toml` file. Update at your own risk!
